### ESP8266 WEMOS 32M

<p>
Well, lets say this model is one of NodeMCUs and it is pretty good for IoT things and project.<br>
This model can be kind of hard to figure out how to set it up and updload your code on it.<br>
For me, as I am a lover of these kind MCUs board and IoT things, it took me to find clibs in russian 
to figure how to deal with it :))))<br>
well lets get down and see what how to do the job.<br>
