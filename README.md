# NodeMCU:
### ESP8266 WEMOS 32M

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>  
Well, lets say this model is one of NodeMCUs and it is pretty good for IoT things and project.<br>
This model can be kind of hard to figure out how to set it up and updload your code on it.<br>
For me, as I am a lover of these kind MCUs board and IoT things, it took me to find clibs in russian 
to figure how to deal with it :))))<br>
well lets get down and see what how to do the job.<br>
</p>
<br>

## Things you need
<p>
1 - ESP8266 WEMOS 32M <br>
2 - micro usb cable <br>
4 - Arduino IDE installed on your PC <br>
3 - a smart phone with blynk app installed on it <br>
</p>

## 1 - Setup things on Arduino IDE
<p>
Well first of all we need to install NodeMCU libs on Arduino IDE. <br>
To do that, you must open Arduino IDE then go to:<br>
File | Prefrences <br>
Then copy the link below in side a bar with the title of "Additional Board Manager URLs:"<br>
copy this link in it: "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" <br>
In this case you can download the NodeMCU boards libs for Arduino IDE :) <br>
To do this go to:  Tool | Boards | Boards Manager <br>
And easily search NodeMCU or ESP8266 and Install it.
